    std::cout << "📍 STEP 1: Broken Version (step1_broken)\n";
    std::cout << "   ❌ Race conditions\n";
    std::cout << "   ❌ Memory corruption\n";
    std::cout << "   ❌ Unpredictable behavior\n";
    std::cout << "   ❌ Crashes\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "📍 STEP 2: Mutex Protection (step2_mutex)\n";
    std::cout << "   ✅ No race conditions\n";
    std::cout << "   ✅ Thread-safe\n";

    std::cout << "1. 🔒 MUTEXES (std::mutex):\n";
    std::cout << "   - Protect shared data from race conditions\n";
    std::cout << "   - Use std::lock_guard for automatic unlock\n";
    std::cout << "   - Critical for multi-threaded ROS 2 nodes\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "2. 📡 CONDITION VARIABLES (std::condition_variable):\n";
    std::cout << "   - Efficient thread coordination\n";
    std::cout << "   - Threads sleep until signaled (no busy-waiting)\n";
    std::cout << "   - Essential for battery-powered embedded systems\n";
    std::cout << "   - Perfect for ROS 2 service/action patterns\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "3. 🔄 LOCKING PATTERNS:\n";
    std::cout << "   - std::lock_guard: Simple RAII locking\n";
    std::cout << "   - std::unique_lock: Flexible locking for condition variables\n";
    std::cout << "   - Always minimize time spent holding locks\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "4. 🎛️ PRODUCER-CONSUMER PATTERN:\n";
    std::cout << "   - Common in ROS 2: sensor data → processing → actuators\n";
    std::cout << "   - Geometric control: multiple agents coordinating\n";
    std::cout << "   - Real-time systems: predictable, efficient coordination\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "🧪 TRY THESE EXPERIMENTS:\n";
    std::cout << "1. Run each version multiple times - notice the differences\n";
    std::cout << "2. Change the timing delays and see how it affects behavior\n";
    std::cout << "3. Add more consumers or producers\n";
    std::cout << "4. Monitor CPU usage during the mutex vs condition variable versions\n\n";
    
    std::cout << "🚀 NEXT STEPS:\n";
    std::cout << "- Apply these patterns in ROS 2 node development\n";
    std::cout << "- Explore bounded buffers (limited size queues)\n";
    std::cout << "- Learn about reader-writer locks for more complex scenarios\n";
    std::cout << "- Study lock-free programming for ultra-high performance\n\n";
